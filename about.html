            <p>
                This project is a GitHub Profile Search web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles by username.
                The application fetches and displays user information, including their avatar, name, bio, followers, following, and public repositories.
                Users can navigate through repositories with pagination, displaying three repositories per page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes the GitHub API to retrieve user data.
                The interface includes a responsive navigation bar with links to the Home and About pages, as well as a placeholder for a Sign In option.
                The application aims to provide a simple and intuitive way to explore GitHub profiles.
